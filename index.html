                <p><strong>Understanding AI: A Conceptual Approach</strong> is a 0.5 credit semester course designed for high school social studies students. Through hands-on experimentation with AI systems, field journal documentation, and critical analysis, students develop AI literacy skills essential for navigating an AI-shaped world. Students investigate how AI works, explore its societal impact, examine bias and fairness in algorithmic systems, and develop effective human-AI collaboration skillsâ€”all without writing code or solving complex equations.</p>
